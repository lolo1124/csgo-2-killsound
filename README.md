# 🔒 Why GSI Is Safe
It's built by Valve for developers, streamers, HUD creators, and apps.

Used by major tools like:

CS:GO HUD overlays (like HLAE)

Tournament broadcast tools

Discord bots that show live stats

It does not modify the game, memory, or files.

It just listens to game data CS sends out voluntarily via HTTP.

# 🔍 What GSI Does
CS:GO/CS2 sends read-only JSON data to your script (like kills, health, etc.).

Your Python app just listens on localhost (your own machine).

# 🔥 Valve’s Stance
“Game State Integration is intended to provide a way to get live game state data in a structured way to help with overlays and analysis.”
